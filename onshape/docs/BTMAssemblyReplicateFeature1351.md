## Methods

### NewBTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351

`func NewBTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351() *BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351`

NewBTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351 instantiates a new BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351 object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewBTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351WithDefaults

`func NewBTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351WithDefaults() *BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351`

NewBTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351WithDefaults instantiates a new BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351 object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetBtType

`func (o *BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351) GetBtType() string`

GetBtType returns the BtType field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetBtTypeOk

`func (o *BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351) GetBtTypeOk() (*string, bool)`

GetBtTypeOk returns a tuple with the BtType field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetBtType

`func (o *BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351) SetBtType(v string)`

SetBtType sets BtType field to given value.

### HasBtType

`func (o *BTMAssemblyReplicateFeature1351) HasBtType() bool`

HasBtType returns a boolean if a field has been set.
